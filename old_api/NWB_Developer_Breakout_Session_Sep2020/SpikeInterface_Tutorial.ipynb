    "In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of using SpikeInterface for extracellular analysis and spike sorting comparison. We will be using the `spikeinterface` from the SpikeInterface github organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "`spikeinterface` wraps 5 subpackages: `spikeextractors`, `spikesorters`, `spiketoolkit`, `spikecomparison`, and `spikewidgets`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we will be using a real dataset recorded from CA1 region in the hippocampus (recording from [CINPLA](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/research/sections/fyscell/cinpla/)). We will show how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- load the data with spikeextractors package\n",
    "- load a probe file\n",
    "- preprocess the signals\n",
    "- run a popular spike sorting algorithm with different parameters\n",
    "- curate the spike sorting output using 1) quality metrics (automatic) - 2) [Phy](https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy) \n",
    "(manual) - 3) consensus-based\n",
    "- save the results to NWB!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend creating a new `spiketutorial` conda environment using:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda env create -f environment.yml`\n",
